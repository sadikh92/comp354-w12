Describe some (at least two) important execution scenarios of the system using UML sequence diagrams.
These scenarios must demonstrate how the various subsystems and units are interacting to achieve a system-level service.
Units and subsystems depicted here must be compatible with the descriptions provided in
section \ref{sec:arch} and \ref{sec:detail}.
