\section{Introduction}
\vspace*{0.1in}
\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of the Task And Role Data Information System (TARDIS) is to implement an effective task management system.
 TARDIS reads an XML file with the tasks, related sub tasks and their respective descriptions. The system provides a series of tools
which allow the user to view and manipulate the entered data. The main role of the system is to organize people and tasks in 
an effective manner by implementing four possible views. In all, TARDIS keeps track of all data pertaining to the tasks and people assigned
to them.
\\[20px]This design document presents the designs used or intended to be used in implementing the project. The designs described, follow the requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specifications document prepared for the project.
\subsection{Scope}
 Firstly, this document is intended for the programming group in Team 3, to use the designs as guidelines to implement the project. Equally, this document is  also for the team's instructor, Dr. Butler, as it fulfils one of the requirements of the project. Lastly, this document could be used for designers who try to upgrade or modify the present design of TARDIS.
\\[20px]The document gives a detailed description of the software architecture of the Task And Role Data Information System (TARDIS).
 It specifies the structure and design  of the modules discussed in the SRS. It also displays some of the use
 cases that had transformed into sequential and activity diagrams. The class diagrams show how the programming team would implement
 the specific module.

\section{Detailed Design} \label{sec:detail}

Complete description of the system design, describing one subsystem separately in respective subsection.
UML class diagrams are to be used, as well as a short textual description describing the purpose of each class.
